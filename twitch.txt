Click is rock-solid and gives you full control. If you’re happy with the working version, I can help you build out:

Twitch clip vs full video detection

Quality presets and fallback logic

Progress bars and download feedback

Config files or environment variable support

Just say the word — we can turn this into a robust CLI tool.
